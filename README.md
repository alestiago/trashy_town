[Trashy Town](https://trashytown.com) is a sustainable, family-friendly game that promotes collectively cleaning public spaces and recycling. Have fun helping Gary collect all the trash of his Trashy Town and recyle it into the correct trash cans.

## Playing

To start cleaning Trashy Town we recommend playing on **Desktop** 🖥 at [trashytown.com](https://trashytown.com).

💡 **Note**: [trashytown.com](https://trashytown.com) also works on **Mobile**.

Alternatively, you can run your own local version by using the Flutter SDK 3.19.0:

```sh
# 🕹️ Play your local version of Trashy Town (from packages/trashy_road):
flutter run -d chrome --release
```

💡 **Note**: You can also run Trashy Town locally on all the other available platforms (MacOS, Windows, Android, iOS, Linux and Web).

If instead, you wish to contribute refer to the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### 🛡️ Admin role

If you wish to run the game in **Admin** role, you should access [trashytown.com/?admin=true](https://trashytown.com/?admin=true).

This will unlock all the levels so you can freely play the game.
