[Trashy Town](https://trashytown.com) is a sustainable, family-friendly game that promotes collectively cleaning and recycling public spaces. Have fun helping Gary collect all the trash of his Trashy Town and recyle it into the correct trash cans.

## Playing

To start cleaning Trashy Town we recommend playing on **Desktop** 🖥 at [trashytown.com](https://trashytown.com).

💡 **Note**: [trashytown.com](https://trashytown.com) also works on **Mobile**.

Alternatively, you can run your own local version by:

```sh
# 🕹️ Play your local version of Trashy Town (from packages/trashy_road):

```

💡 **Note**: You can also run Trashy Town locally on all the other available platforms (MacOS, Windows, Android, iOS, Linux and Web).
